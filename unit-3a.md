# Context
- macroeconomics vs microeconomics
- https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-microeconomics-and-macroeconomics/

# slide 3: Malcolm Gladwell
- what is the thesis of the talk
- what evidence does the talk use
- what are the implications of his presentation
- how does he alter our understanding of choice

- in Pepsi sugar data experiment, data is not a bell curve
- should look for perfect Pepsis rather than THE perfect Pepsi
- Dr. Wolowitz made impact on, by introducing idea of having multiple options
  - Pepsi
  - Pickles
  - Campbell's Soup
  - Prego
- changed the way the food industry thinks - paradigm
- existing assumptions
  - way to find out what people want to eat is to ask them
    - contradicted by 1/3 not knowing they want Prego
    - people don't know what they want
  - realize the importance of "horizontal segmentation"
    - "horizontal segmentation" = diversity
    - going from one-size-fits-all approach to selling many products for different "clusters" of customers
    - products are on a horizontal plane
      - there is no good or bad, or perfect
      - different kinds of mustard suit different kinds of people
  - confronted the notion of the platonic dish
    - idea that there is a perfect dish
    - "this is the way it ought to be done"
    - e.g. platonic tomato sauce
  - move in the last 10-15 years from seeking universals to the understanding of variability
    - Howard was against pursuing universals in the food industry
- thesis: in embracing the diversity of human beings, we will find a surer way to true happiness

# slide 4: Business Cycle
- business cycle
  - economy has a line representing GDP growth over time
  - shows fluctuations in a nation's aggregate output and employment over time
  - has four stages - peak, recession, trough, expansion
  - measured in terms of real GDP and time
- weaknesses of business cycle mode
  - doesn't account for the human cost to recessions
  - if it's so predictable, then why are economists so bad at predicting economic trends
    - officially, recession is when GDP falls for 6 months (2 quarters)
    - falling GDP is a symptom of a recession, is not a predictor
    - instead, economists track consumer confidence, yield curve, etc.
    - recently popularized "Sahm Rule" is very cool
- output gaps
  - difference between actual output and potential output in business cycle
  - potential output
    - nation could be producing if all of its resources were being used effiicently
    - basically just using the long-term growth trend
    - two cases
      - actual output > potential output
        - aggregate demand has grown faster than aggregate supply
          - unemployment rate is lower than the natural rate of unemployment
      - potential output > actual output
  - output gaps occur any time when the actual level output is different from the potential output, i.e. not = to the full-employment level of output
    - negative output gap
      - actual output is less than potential output
      - aka recession/deflationary gap
      - often seen in recessions, not necessarily the same (recession != recessionary gap)
    - positive output gap
      - actual output is greater than potential output
      - aka inflationary gap
      - often seen in inflationary conditions, once again, not necessarily the same
      - is possible because in a short period of time, beyond the full-employment level of output - may not be sustainable in the long-run (unsustainable use of the factors of production)
      - overheating economy

- idea of business cycles is built out of Keynes' ideas
- examines fluctuations in production
- the economy goes through peaks, recessions, troughs, and expansions

# slide 5: Business Cycle (Peak)
- economy is at near capacity
- near or full employment
- represents a turning point
- usually involves some kind of panic

# slide 6: Business Cycle (Recession)
- sometimes referred to as the contractionary period
- when seasonally adjusted GDP declines for more than 2 quarters
- characterized by
  - businesses cut production
  - investment down
  - consumer spending down
- prolonged recession = depression

# slide 7: Business Cycle (Trough)
- lowest point of the business cycle
- characterized by
  - low demand for labor and factories
  - low profits
  - represents turning points towards expansion

# slide 8: Business Cycle (Expansion)
- sometimes referred to as inflationary period
- real GDP begins to grow
- characterized by
  - increased consumption
  - increased expenditures
  - increased investment

# slide 10-17: Business Cycle Fluctuations
- spending and savings
  - current disposable income
    - greater GDP, greater disposable income
    - same thing, in reverse
  - expectations of future income
    - if good prospects, likely to spend currently without worrying too much
    - if bad prospects, likely to try to save as much you can in anticipation of crisis
  - availability of credit
  - interest rates (applies to individuals, consumers)
    - low interest rates
      - more borrowing
      - more spending, less saving
    - high interest rates
      - less borrowing
      - more spending, less saving
  - expectation of future price
  - wealthy
- investment (all relate to interest rate)
  - key ideas
    - volatility of investment
    - shifts in residential construction
    - investments in plants and equipment
  - if inventories are running low, this shows how fast trade is going
  - high interest rates = low inventory, as that is basically dead money laying around since inventory represnets moeny
  - is why JIT is a thing, to avoid holding inventory (e.g. Toyota)
  - relate to hoarding in homes
  - when velocity drops when more gets tied up in inventory, economy starts to slow
  - paradoxically, cash is a liability for banks (they lose money if it's not out doing something)
- savings
  - saving is considered a leakage, as savings represent money outside the economy
  - ROI = return on investment
  - leakage vs injection (investment)
  - must be offset by investments (I) to balance the economy
  - image on slide
  - discussion
    - wealthy are not affected by inflation
    - most people are well-paid, not wealthy
    - can you meet your debt obligations if source of money goes away
      - yes, then wealthy
      - otherwise, you're simply well-paid
    - saving money is how you go from well-paid to wealthy
- 2 purposes of investments
  - 1. increase economy's capacity to produce
  - 2. offset leakage of savings
    - contribution to national income
  - any change in investment has a huge impact on the economy and is one of the major causes of fluctuations
  - application of circular flow diagram

- considerations (summary?)
  - volatility of inventories
  - shifts in residential construction
  - investment in plant and equipment
  - rate of return of investment
  - expectations of the future
  - rate of interest
  - role of financial intermediariesâ€”lat
  - role of government
    - goods and services
    - taxation (t)
    - foreign trade (X-M)

# Macroeconomic Policy (Monetary Policy)
- what
  - raises interest rates
- objectives and aims
  - tame inflation with high interest rates
  - inflation b/c of excess demand, inadequate supply
  - raising interest rate does not suddenly affect above two things
  - interest rates are the only macroeconomic tool they have
  - price caps would be an alternative, but come with many issues
- effects

  - people living paycheck to paycheck have no room in their budget for inflation
  - warns of recession
  - interest rate controls inflation
  - however, cannot control supply

- thesis
  - is raising interest rate helping?
  - BoC is using monetary policy to tame inflation by inreasing interest rates
- info
  - gov -> fiscal, BoC -> monetary

# Multiplier

- total investment spending typically accounts for only about 1/5 of GDP
- fluctuations in investment lead to only a 2% change in GDP
- multiplier effect
  - if someone has more money, they buy things and spend money there
- marginal propensity to consume (MPC)
  - tendency to spend the money you have in your pocket
- marginal propensity to withdraw/save (MPW/MPS)
  - the
- multiplier is 1/MPW OR 1/(1-MPC)
- MPC, MPW are represented as fractions
- k is a constant

- spending multiplier
  - when the government spends money, it become's somebody's income
  - a portion of this income is saved and the rest is spent
  - continuing this over and over again through various transactions, is the multiplier effect
  - how big amount is multiplied with depends on how much people spend vs. save, i.e. MPC and MPS (MPC + MPS = 1)
  - assumption for simple model is that everyone has the same MPC, MPS
  - simple spending multiplier = 1/MPS
- such a thing as the tax multiplier
  - rshows what happens when the government cuts taxes
  - equation is MPC
  - is 1 less than the spending multiplier
- money multiplier

# examples

- total impact/investment = initial investment \* multiplier
- multiplier calculation: (MPW + MPC = 1)
  - 1/MPW
  - 1/(1-MPC)
- total impact includes original investment
- e.g. 30 \* 1/(1-0.75) = 120

# Accelerator

- principle by which changes in consumer changed cause magnified changes in the rate of capital investment by businesses
- creates a situation where supply exceeds demand
- induced investment
  - increase capital equipment as a result of increased consumer demand
- downside steeper than upside
- conclusion (incomplete)
- diffferent levels of exposure to risk
- more further from the consumer, the more drastic the change
- those lower in the tiered system get affected

  - exporting unemployment

- accelerator and multiplier can run in reverse

# the

- consumer indebtedness
- easy money, tight money
  - how eager is the bank to take your money

investment (I)

- interest rates (money supply)
- profit expectations on investment projects
- business taxes
- technology
- degree of excess capacity

FE = full employment
left of FE line, less supply + more demand
right of FE line, more supply + less demand

underutilized = can produce more efficiently
right of FE line,

# Aggregate Supply

- all of the supply (aggregate = everything)

- AD line can only move in two directions
- AS line can move in four directions

  - entire line can move
  - only the tail part can move alone on its own

- change in FE point, ability to produce will change AS line

- considerations

  - does it affect in consumption?
    - formulae discussed before
  - change in FE?
  - producing amt changed?

- basically, checking if demand changes or supply

- legal-institutional env
  - business taxes, subsidies
  - government regulation (red-tape)
    - any red-tape increases cost of production

(missed one day b/c of contest)

# AD/AS

- combination of individual demand, supply curves
- as equilibrium on AS/AD moves around, reflects phases of business cycle
- one AS/AD = one point on business cycle curve
- graphs
  - full employment important = sustainable
  - FE point vs equilibrium point (relationship)
    - recessionary gap = if equilbirum below full empoymetn grah, downward pressure
    - expansionary/inflatioanry gap = if equilibrium exceeds full emploemnet, upward pressure
      - will trigger accelerator, will shift FE point forward
  - FE point
    - labor and tech is effectively utilized
    - sustainable use of resources
  - all of these considerations are in the short-term, because too much can change in the long-run
- relationship between multiplier and acc
  - multiplier triggers accelerator
  - multiplier goes up, more spending
- multiplier
  - is about the consumer
- accelerator
  - when investing in anticipation of demand
  - is a response to consumer spending
  - so could reduce spending or increase spending

aggregate supply/demand

- AS, AD, QAS, QAD, price level

different types of money

- based on liquidity
  - ability to convrt frm one forem to another
  - e.g. elon musk has liquidity issue (large net worth, little fluid worth)
- each tier contains more and more that is harder to change (make liquid)

monetary polict

- cost-push inflation
- demand-pull inflation

underlying bias for all diagram is Smith's belief in continuous growth (only can go upwards)

monetary policy is Bank of Canada
fiscal policy is the government I think

- the

- left and right in case of change in ability to produce
- if there is a cost change, then the tail part moves up and down
