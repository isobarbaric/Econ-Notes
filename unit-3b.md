# why always analyze thesis?
- understand that information is conveyed this way
    - humans have a bias
    - trained in this way, to outline things this way (thesis + 3 args)
- appeal to bias to convince/persuade

# slide 1
- thesis
    - the world is much more different than what it was
    - teacher
        - title: did you know
        - last text: so what does it all mean
        - theses
            - prepare for the rapid future
- evidence
    - jobs today didn't exist some years ago
    - projected 10-14 jobs by age 38
    - changing employers frequently
    - social media + internet
    - degrees becomes irrelevant b/c of how fast information advances
    - reaching people is easuer
    - more words in english langyage
    - fast-moving technology
- implications
    - change in profession (Mr. Tozer)
    - going to uni to learn how to learn
    - suggesting a generalized degree

# slide 
- GDP/GNP
    - gross domestic product
        - within frontiers of
    - gross national product
        - owner of the company
    - limitations of GDP
        - does not include non-market activies
          - e.g. taxi vs relative driving you to airport
        - does not include informal economy
    - nominal vs. real GDP & GDP per capita
- ways of measuring GDP
    - expenditure approach; GDP = C + I + G + (X-M)
        - focused on purchases
        - we don't count intermediate goods
          - defn: used as inputs in the production of other goods including final goods
        - only four entities that can purchase things in the economy
          - consumers (consumer spending)
          - businesses (investment spending)
          - government (government spending)
          - other countries, i.e. net exports (exports - imports)
    - income approach; national income = wages + rent + interest + profit
        - looking at income earned by all of those purchases
        - everybody's spending is someone else's income
        - results in the same number
        - represent all sources of income from selling all the goods and services in a given year
            - wages, rent, interest, profit
    - value-added approach
        - adding up the value added at each stage in the production process
* difference between value added and profit
    - added value != the net profit of the business
    - added value = difference between selling price of product and cost to produce it
    - excludes other costs such as marketing or financial costs-
    - meanwhile, net income takes into account all costs
- things that don't count in GDP
    - intermediate goods
    - used goods
    - financial transactions (nothing new is produced)
    - transfer payments
- income
- expenditure approach

- gini index is correlated to stability of the country


# Labour Force
- is a co
- 3 categories of people to consider
    - total population
    - working-age population
    - labor force
- labor force participation rate = working age/labor force
- types of unemployment
    - seasonal
        - employment based on season
        - e.g. mowing grass, snow shovelling
    - frictional
        - time between switching jobs
    - structural
        - economy shifted, your job does/does not exist now
        - e.g.
            - blacksmith doesn't exist as a profession anymore
            - rn there is structural unemployment as people working remote makes cleaners redundant
    - cyclical
        - results directly from cycles of economic upturn and downturn
        - increase during recession, decrease during growth
        - e.g. increase in cyclical unemployment during COVID-19
- categories in labor force
    - A = employed
        - did paid work during week
    - B = unemployed
        - was available for work but no paid work
        - starts a job in __ weeks
    - labor force (LF) = A + B
    - unemployment rate = B/LF * 100
- note how labor force does not count the entire population
    - e.g. Ronald Reagan adding the military to the employment figure (decreases unemployment rate)
- participation rate = LF/working age population
- employment rate = A/working age population
- working age population is a subset of the population of ages 15-65

# Limitations
- underemployment
    - Ph.D working at Wendy's, Taco Bell
- discouraged workers
    - people that have given up in finding work
- dishonest workers
    - e.g. working a secret side hustle to make money

# full employment
- highest expectation
- unemployment percentage
    - 3% is frictional
- post-60s, 6-8%
    - difference is EI (unemployment insurance)
- structural change
    - declining manufacturing - service
- unemployment insurance
    - people are more willing to be unemployed for longer periods
    - politically, it works for the state to give money to prevent revolution
- participation rates
    - most teenagers usually unskilled, more frictional
    - exceptions life guard, tutoring
- minimum wage
    - increased number willing, able to work
    - increased the # of people in the labor force

objectives of this course:
- understanding choices have consequences
- there are trade-offs for every decision
- question assumptions and understandings

consumer price index
- most widely used indicator of inflation
- shopping basket, determine change in cost of bucket
- comparative purchases, how many people did
- includes utilities
- adjustments for changes in quality, quantity
- usage
    - adjsuting wages, pensions
    - evaluate performance of economy
    - make monetary, fiscal policy

- sizeflation/shrinkflation
    - keep price the same, decrease quantity
- greedflation

- deflation
    - very bad for an economy

- urban vs rural
    - does not account for rural side as much

housing is significant part of CPI
    - increase in housing as large effect on entire calculatioin

- food is generally one of the first areas to take a hit when inflation gets bad

# Limitations of CPI
- consumer differences
- changes in spending patterns
- product quality

# Simon Sinek
- thesis
    - people don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it (repeated it, was catchy)
- evudebce
    - golden circle as basis of argument
        - why
            - profit is a result
            - why = purpose, belief
        - how (USP)
        - what
    - normal, go from outside to inside
    - great = inside to outside
    - people do't buy what you do, why you do
    - three main reasons
        - biology = structure of human brain
            - neocortex (what)
            - limbic brains 
                - (feelings e.g. trust, loyalty)
                - thing that cnotrols behaviro/decision making
        - law of diffusion of innnovation (bell curve)
            - mass market success not possible until 15-18% market penetration
            - gap between 10 and 15-18% mark is significant to get over
            - e.g. juxtaposition of Wright vs. Langley (zealots vs employees)
    - people show up for themselves when it's about your ideas rather than you
    - leaders vs. lead
        - leaders = position fo power
        - those who lead = they inspire, not because we have to, we want to (not for them, for ourselves
    - starting with 'why' is key
        - e.g. MLK's "I have a dream" instead of "I have a plan"
- repeated use of visuals without telling us before
- implications
    - he believes in patterns of behavior/instinct
    - reduced free will
    - ideology (why) means they you will be subservient (relates to state security)

# Other Common Stats
- leading indicator
    - someone predicts the future, they vision gives us idea of what it might be like
- lagging indicator
    - tells us what has happened so far
- these two indicators should never be used in isolation - triangulation necessary
- when looking at a stat, should consider whether leading or lagging

# the
- intrinsic vs extrinsic motivator (thesis also relates to this)
- thesis: mismatch between what science knows and what businesses do
- higher incentives led to poorer performa
