# slide 2: Government
- understanding
  - statistics
  - economic tools, e.g. accelerator & multiplier
- ideology dictates how we act

# slide 3: Smith's World
- beliefs
  - best interests of the people is served by self-interest
  - staunch belief in life, liberty and private property
    - courts are for property disputes
  - need certain amount of property + and to be a white male to vote
- minimal government involvement
- role of government
    - defense
    - public order
      - police's job is to protect private property
    - breaking up of monopolies
- subscribes to a
    - Hobbesian worldview
    - Macchiavellian worldview
- (quote) "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer"

# slide 4: Marx's World
- government for the people
    - no private property
    - eventually government will be swept away (by workers' revolution?)
- both the means and modes of production will be dominated by the proleteriat
    - proleteriat = working class
- for benefit of proleteriat
- private property = theft
- capitalist system was based on the exploitation of the working class by the bourgeoisie
- this inequality and class struggle would eventually lead to a revolution of the proletariat, resulting in the establishment of a socialist society
- believed that this new society would bring economic and social equality, as well as greater freedom and opportunity for all

# slide 5: Keynes' World
- government shoul be actively interventionist
- responsibility = manage the economy in the best interests of the people
- prevent fluctuations
- desperate men make desperate choices
  - desperation will lead people to extremist ways to fix things
  - relate to the rise of dictators and police states
- analogy to machine
  - economy operates like a machine
  - government spending being the grease that keeps it from slowing down
- markets and economies could not be relied upon to regulate themselves
- instead, need active intervention to prevent economic downturns and create economic stability
- pursue fiscal policies such as taxation and public spending in order to
  - promote economic growth
  - reduce unemployment
  - increase wages
- advocated for international cooperation and coordination in order to create a stable, prosperous world economy.

# slide 6: Von Hayek's World
- free markets will lead to free people
  - free market was the only economic system that allowed for the efficient allocation of resources
  - most effective way to achieve social and economic progress was to allow individuals to make their own decisions and to allow the market to determine prices and production
- freedom is the ultimate good
- government intervention
  - government should intervene only areas where there is no profit (health care, defense, etc.)
  - should only intervene in the economy to protect property rights, enforce contracts, and provide a stable currency
  - government intervention beyond what was necessary would lead to inefficient outcomes, such as inflation and unemployment
- strong civil liberties, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of association
- shared idea with Smith: life, liberty and private property

# slide 8-9: Money Revisited
- five characteristics of money
  - divisible
  - durable
    - retain usefulness for future exchanges
    - perishable good = good that degrades quickly (would be less useful for future transactions)
    - trying to use a non-durable good as money conflicts with money's essential future-oriented use and value
  - portable
    - should be easy to carry and divide so that a worthwhile quantity can be carried on one's person or transported
    - use good difficult or inconvenient to carry as money could require physical transportation that results in transaction costs
  - recognizable
    - authenticity, quantity of good should be readily apparent to users so that they can easily agree to the terms of an exchange
    - non-recognizable good as money can result in transaction costs relating to authenticating the goods and agreeing on the quantity needed for an exchange
  - scarce
- is a means of exchange generally accepted for any good or service
- four functions (don't confuse with five attributes of money)
    - medium of exchange
      - can exchange stuff with money
    - measure of value or account
      - allows comparison of values between different items
    - store of value
      - example = work in the summer, don't have to work in the fall (storing labor)
    - standard of deferred payment
      - allows transactions with credit

# Demand for Money
- three motivations for money
  - transaction motive
    - immediate purchases
  - precautionary motive (saving for unforseen circumstances)
    - money for emergencies
  - speculative motive
    - hold money to buy stocks or bonds for profit
- money has a demand/supply line like any other product
- quantitative easing affects the supply of money in the system
- interest rates affect the demand for money

# Money Supply in Canada
- types (m0 and m4 are not very useful)
  - m0
    - is straight cash
    - only Canadian cash
  - m1
    - cash or checking account, money immediately accesible
    - very liquid
  - m2
    - takes a couple of days
    - some days (15-30 days)
    - less than a year (slower accessibl)
    - fairly asccesible
    - m2+ only? includes foreign exchange money in our system
      - e.g. USD Dollar in Canadian banks
  - m3
    - m3+ includes foreign trade
    - (182-365 days), or 2 years or whatever
- m2 includes m1
- m2+ includes m2
- m3 includes all of m2
- anything that includes debt is not included on this

# Monetary Policy
- is a macroeconomic policy laid down by the central bank
- involves management of money supply and interest rate and is a demand-side economic policy
- done to achieve macroeconomic objectives like inflation, consumption, growth, and liquidity


- for a bank, deposits are a liability




# TED Presentation
- What we miss when we focus on the average
  - thesis? = world is a lot messier than averages can make out to be
  - examining outliers gives insight
  - typical approach is to undervalue the outleirs
  - emotional connection (anecdotal example of mother)
    - we are all outliers in a way
  - when we focus on the average and ignore the outliers, we lose all the richness and insights those stories provide
- The Rise of Surveillance Capitalism
  - starts with anecdotal example of phone addiction
  - participating in the greatest socio-economic experiment yet
  - tech knows just about everything about you
  - surveillance business model
    - based on users, gather data and store massive
  - ...



- zero-cost overhead
- only need computers + mercenaries (people working just for money)
- appearance of competition
  - Simplii Financial owned be CIBC
  - Tangerine owned by Scotiabank



# Discretionary Fiscal Policy
- expansionary policies (Hayek-ian)
  - injects money into the economy
  - triggering multiplier and accelerator
  - ways
    - more government spending
    - lower taxes
  - government should not be moderator, individuals should
- contractionary policies
  - slashes costs
    - most acceptable way is infrastructure
  - ways
    - less spending
    - higher taxes

Bank of Canada
- feduciary
